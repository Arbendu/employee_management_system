# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# employee_management_system
I developed an Employee Management System using React and localStorage for data management. The project features two dashboards: an Admin Dashboard, where the admin can assign tasks to employees, and an Employee Dashboard, where employees can view their assigned tasks.
